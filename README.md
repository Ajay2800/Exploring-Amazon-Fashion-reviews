2. Clustering
Clustering analysis is used to identify distinct customer segments based on their review patterns and preferences. By grouping similar reviews together, this analysis uncovers underlying patterns and preferences among different customer segments. This information is valuable for developing targeted marketing strategies and personalized recommendations.

3. Topic Modeling
Topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), are applied to extract latent topics from the reviews. This analysis identifies recurring themes and topics within the reviews, providing deeper insights into customer interests, preferences, and concerns regarding fashion products.

4. Rating Predictions
Classification algorithms are utilized to predict product ratings based on the textual content of the reviews. Machine learning models are trained to accurately predict ratings, assisting consumers in making informed purchasing decisions. This analysis also helps in identifying factors that influence customer satisfaction and product ratings.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of Amazon Fashion reviews, offering valuable insights for both consumers and businesses. By leveraging sentiment analysis, clustering, topic modeling, and rating predictions, it enhances the understanding of customer feedback and aids in improving the online shopping experience.
