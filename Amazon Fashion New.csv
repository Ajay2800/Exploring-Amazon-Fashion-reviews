About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks.

I've tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn't wear them.  I'd given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn't bought or tried any earrings for a few years.

When these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven't bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.

I noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.

Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off. As long as you're okay starting your run with slightly cold hands, these could be for you.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using these gloves on and off for about a month now, and so far I've found them to be a great purchase. I usually go for runs around 5 a.m., and this has allowed me to test them out in temps that have resided in the mid-30s. So far, so good. They do the job.

Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly ""pretty"" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.

When I ordered these, I got a 15... and I probably could wear a 16.  So...  these things run pretty small.  They will be used for a costume getup (no, it's not a drag outfit!).

Another thing I quickly discovered... maybe this is just because I have never worn knee high boots or heels of any kind before...  but when you stand flat and do not move, the ""plane"" of the bottom of the boot is wrong.  First, the toe plate... it's not so much curved as it is a slight ""V"" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.  But it seems like it should have a flatter sole.

The 'patent leather' is VERY thin.  Not that I expected much, it's a $50 boot, not a $500 one.  In a way this is good because it stretches to stay tight around my huge calves.

I can tell it's going to take a while to get used to walking in them, but I'll get comfortable with them in time.

I purchased men's size ""Medium"" based on the fact that I bought the same 3-pack last year in size ""Large"" and the fit was bigger than I wanted.  I am 5'10"", 195lbs and usually wear a size ""Large"" in most men's tops.

In terms of sizing I was looking for a fit that is slightly snug versus too baggy (as the Larges were for me) so now that I have the size Mediums they are working out much better for my preference (especially since I've noticed they also tend to stretch out a bit over time).  Bad news is I have 6 of these tshirts clogging up my dresser drawers now, good news is since I have the Medium and Large sizes I can gain a few pounds and I'm still good to go (beer me).

I do agree with some other reviewers that CK tshirts do tend to be thin material and they aren't your typical stand alone t-shirt you can show off about town.  They are good tshirts under another piece of clothing, as pajama top, or working around the yard.  I actually like the fact that CK v-necks are thin because they are very comfortable to wear for incognito usage.

Style-wise a good looking t-shirt with nice looking v-neck shape.

His favorite part about these shirts is that you can barely feel the material in comparison to all of his cotton shirts.  So, they're definitely light/thin material.  He would never wear them as a regular shirt unless it's in a casual setting (e.g. to bed).

Regardless, they work GREAT for wearing under buttoned dress shirts or dressy sweaters, and I'll definitely be buying the white ones for him soon enough.

Oh, as for the fit, I obviously can't personally comment on it, but for him the XL worked great.  He's all around a huge guy (height, weight, and his shoulders) and while he normally wears XLs, sometimes they fit too tight on him due to his shoulders and neck.  This XL fit perfectly with a little room to spare, so if you're a bigger person with regards to your height and shoulders, get your normal size, otherwise definitely size down.","{'Size:': ' X-Large', 'Color:': ' Black'}",5,Great for undershirt use,AA@@,,TRUE

They can be used as a black under-shirt, if ever needed, but I love to wear these as every day shirts.  The nice cotton design is comfortable and washes great. After many washes I still find the shirt to be comfortable and fit the same way as always (the first wash/dry might make it - like all shirts - shrink a little).

These are some of my favorite shirts to wear, and I wear them all the time.

They fit as you would expect, I purchased medium (as I purchase medium shirts always) and it fit as it should.  At first it was a little too big, but after the first wash/dry it shaped properly and fits perfectly now.

The material is thick, and it doesn't' feel cheap at all, while it is nice and soft and great for sleeping in too (your significant other will love the softness of the material!).

When I purchased them, they were on sale and a great value - but even at regular price these shirts are definitely a great buy and can be worn as an every day shirt, as a black under shirt, or as a nice comfortable at home/night shirt.  I have recommend these (and the white versions, as undershirts) to my friends and purchase new ones every so often when I lose them, or people take them!

Lastly, they are made to last! I have had some of these for more than a year (coming up on almost two years, actually) and they still look great and fit perfectly -- after about a year I usually retire them to night shirts and get new fresh ones (as I tend to stain them here and there and wear them so much that I like to purchase fresh ones to wear out -- don't don't let that make you think they don't last, I could absolutely still wear them out if I wanted to!).

Calvin Klein is a great brand, and makes great V-Necks (in all colors!).","{'Size:': ' Medium', 'Color:': ' Black'}",5,Great V-Necks! Wear them every day.,Neima Nakhaee,,TRUE

With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0"" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes/dries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing/drying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying.","{'Size:': ' X-Large', 'Color:': ' Black'}",4,Great Shirts,Ryan Potts,,TRUE

I'm about to place my 3rd order of these shirts. I ordered 9 over one year ago, and 9 one year prior to that. I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.

OLDER Revew:
I wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts. These guys soak up my sweat, and wash very easy. They also have delivered on being white for longer than quite a few other shirts I have owned before them. I'll be reordering more of these when they wear out, but for now, they're holding up quite well.","{'Size:': ' Medium', 'Color:': ' White'}",5,Only flaw after 1 year of massive abuse is a little color fading.,KMA &amp; TKA,17,TRUE

The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day.

I've bought several of their sterling silver chains, including 2 box links, and the quality exceeded all my expectations in each case.  The chains are sturdy, yet maintain their smooth flexibility over time. There is no ""play"" between the links and, though all are fine guage, even the thinnest has a heft that just feels ""expensive"" (kind of like the sound and solid feel of the closing of an expensive car door).  The clasps easily slide into their housing and the spring is taut yet easy to manage with no ""hanging"".

  I personally own only 1 box link chain, one my kids bought me about 10 years ago in a little specialty shop. It was just the right size for me (about 1/16th"" thick link), heavy, and cost $150.00 at the time.  I know, I swallowed my tongue, too.  But it was a very special celebration and came from their hearts with a little help from Mom.  Definitely a stretch on our budget but they felt the chain was important (and I bring it up as a comparative price for fine Sterling 10 years ago). But afterward I learned that there were roving silver artists who sold their work for whatever was necessary to build their business.  We just had to trip over them if we found them at all in this city or that.  Certainly, today you can find cheaply priced silver chains any number of places but, likely as not, you end up with a cheaply constructed chain, possibly even an overlay or plating, links that kink or break, clasps that don't quite ""seat"" properly or fail altogether.  Gem Avenue is the smooth ride on tarmac after a juddering of a day driving over rock-strewn.  These craftsmen take obvious pleasure and pride in their silver-work and it does show.  And to beat it all, they're pricing this fine sterling as if it was costume jewelry.  Oh, and they thoughtfully toss in a nice little jewelry box for each chain purchased.  Why spend so much time reviewing a few silver chains?  Heaven knows if there were problems with the products we'd see postings in those CAPITAL LETTERS with which some express their fury that something was not to their liking.  When a company obviously cares about their products and seems to see each silver chain as a representative of their company, as this company appears to, the suits need to know that the people doing the actual creative work are doing a cut above and that brings back repeat and new customers via referral and ""through the grapevine.

You will be quite happily surprised with what you buy here. Always a fine experience.

I have two silver pendants that I like to wear often so it was important to get a chain for each that would withstand daily wear.  Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.

So, I ran home during lunch that day and went on Amazon to buy the chain.  I was so worried I wasn't going to find a chain that could be delivered to my house by Christmas.  Finally, when I almost gave up, out of all the box chains and sellers on Amazon, there was only one seller, Gemavenue, who's last acceptable order date for the holidays was still within the time limits.  So, I bought their box chain and it was perfect because I was able to choose the length I needed and it was thin but sturdy, like I had been looking for.

I have been riding for almost 15 years, and I can honestly say, that entire time I would long for good warm boots in the winter!!  I would dread getting off at some points because I knew my toes were going to throb the minute they touched the ground!  I do alot of outdoor riding, even in the winter months, and living in Northeast Pennsylvania you NEED a great pair of winter boots.  The older I got, the more I wanted durable, warm boots that were also comfortable enough to wear around the barn.  These are those boots!!  My toes stay warm even during the coldest months of winter and even during a trail ride!  They do feel a tad snug the first few times until they break in, but after that, they are wonderful.  I would recommend these boots for anyone who is looking for a durable, stylish WARM pair of winter boots!!

UPDATE APRIL 2014:

I JUST had to order another pair!  They lasted me the past 3.5 years and up until about Mid-January/Early February they were still keeping my feet considerably warmer than my warm season paddock boots.  They did start to crack and the soles were coming completely away from the rest of the boot, but I am at the barn 4-5 times a week, sometimes riding 2 or more horses a day.  They DO take a few rides to break in and they are a bit bulkier than your average paddock boot b/c of the insulation but I personally am not a fan of too small of an iron so I have had no issue with them becoming stuck in my irons.  And believe me, my trainer is big on ""drop your irons!"" and I have no problem getting my feet out or back in them.  I also don't lace them all the way up, I leave one out until they get really nice and broken in until I can do that, or my heel doesn't get as far down.  I had actually ordered a pair of Ariat Bossard Insulated Paddock Zips and sent them back b/c they were ridiculously stiff and tight.  Promptly ordered my old go too's and am happy I did because I got them in time to break them in before this winter season was over so no need to worry about that next year!

I started looking around for a hat that would address all those shortcomings and everywhere I looked, I kept seeing ""Henschel Breezer"".  So, more digging led me to Amazon and all the reviews of said hat.  The reviews were good, the price was right and the best part is, made in America.

Ordered it and as with all things Amazon, it arrived on time and packaged perfectly to protect it.  I've used it every weekend and numerous other times in the aforementioned heinous heat and humidity and it has performed flawlessly.

I did use sun block, but worried less about re-application every 80 minutes on my face, ears and neck than I did for my arms and legs.

Buxton owns the rights to the Dopp name and produces these ""official Dopp"" kits. The leather is good, feels solid and well stitched, but you can also get them in a slightly less expensive PVC leatherette version. You can also find these in some stores although the ones I found were double in price. Sometimes the bottoms are leather and sometimes the bottoms were a beaded plastic. Frankly I made sure to get the beaded plastic as it will last longer than a leather bottom. The key features if this Dopp kit are: 1) Construction feels solid. (Although the tag says made in China...you would feel better if it had a proud to be made in the USA tag...however, I don't think this is an issue here.) The leather and stitching feels strong. The zipper is a hefty enough piece of metal that will last. The leather handle is small enough that it fits under the fold of the kit's side if you do not want to use it. The inside is a traditional liner with a single razor pouch, however, the liner and pouch feel like they are made of a newer composite plastic material than the older plastic liners these type of kits used to have. The liner feels stronger and I doubt it will rip, which often happened with travel kits. 2) It has Dopp stamped on it, on two flaps/tabs. The tabs are aesthetic choices but look good and remind you that you have a ""real"" Dopp and not some random ""Men's Toiletry Bag.""  There are newer types of ""Dopp"" kit's out there made out of nylon mesh. If you like that I would recommend something by L.L. Bean or Swiss Army.

Pros:
- Feels and smells like genuine leather, smooth leather. (It's better to use leather care lotion once in a while as mine has started to show some creases, probably due to hot weather)
- Neat and strong stitching along the bottom, the opening, and the inner artificial fabric (see photos)
- Bottom material is made of waterproof artificial fabric, wide and hard
Cons:
- I wish the inside pouch were slightly bigger, with a zipper so stuff won't fall off, and can store more stuff
- Holds less and more expensive than my Nautica travel kit (see photos)

Even my daughter, looked somewhat like a bobble-head with the huge helmet over her head!

The push-lock feature used to close the visor, should be the same feature used to open itnot a push button. As many others have stated in the reviews, this makes the helmet more prone to malfunction or to be easily broken if mishandled or dropped. My daughter only wore this helmet  for 24 hours on Halloween; after hours of pushing & releasing the visor/button all day, I carefully put the helmet back in the box.

  Disruption will only accelerate. The quantity and diversity of connected devices--many of which we haven't imagined yet--will explode, as will the quantity and diversity of the people around the world who use them.
  Our existing standards, workflows, and infrastructure won't hold up. Today's onslaught of devices is already pushing them to the breaking point. They can't withstand what's ahead.
  Proprietary solutions will dominate at first. Innovation necessarily precedes standardization. Technologists will scramble to these solutions before realizing (yet again) that a standardized platform is needed to maintain sanity.
  The standards process will be painfully slow. We will struggle with (and eventually agree upon) appropriate standards. During this period, the web will fall even further behind proprietary solutions.

"07 8, 2007",1183852800,A171GOWULTNYK2,,B0009A6KFA,"When I received my ring, it was very apparent that it was made incorrectly. There was a huge gap between the diamond and the setting but only on one side. I contacted customer service to see if this could be repaired and was told that since it was a purchase over $300.00, I could only get a refund. I advised them I would be overnighting the ring back and would wait for my refund. After 7 days of waiting for my money, I received a ""repaired ring"" which ended up looking just as bad as the first one. It was the original ring that someone had poorly attempted to close the gap on the band. Not only was there still a gap, but now one side of the ring sat higher than the other. I immediately called customer service because I did not ask for another ring to be sent and explained that I had been waiting for a refund. The rep that I spoke to said he didn't see any documentation of a new ring being shipped or the old one being repaired. He told me that he would call me first thing the next morning after speaking to some of his colleagues to get this resolved. I waited 2 days and still had not heard anything so I called again. I spoke to a different rep who assured me I would have my refund the next day. I told her that I had already been waiting almost two weeks for this refund. She said she would put a rush on it but that never happened. I never did hear back from the 2 reps that I spoke with as they both promised to call me with an update. After waiting over 3 weeks I finally received my refund. My experience with Amazon was horrible. Not only was the product poorly constructed but the customer service department was no help at all. They made several promises that they did not keep and never made an attempt to keep me informed with the status of my issue. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!! Thank you for taking the time to read this...

Remember that when I go to buy a ring in a store, the level of service is quite different compare to Blockbuster. You offer far more info on DVDs, then on a ring. I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring to be sent before the actual shipment in very high resolution.

The bad and very bad:

1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.

2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.

3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K

4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...

5. Engraving on the ring says ""Amazon"" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!

6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. Not just return policy.

7. Back to pictures. Usually, when you buy the stone in a store, you have an opportunity to look at the diamond with 10x magnification. So, I expect the picture like this when I select the diamond.

The good:

1. Having the scan of the diamond certificate is great.

2. Automated diamond search system is very good.

I was quite content with the 8 crayon package, but what happened as A result is that my ability to name colors is impaired. I can see, differentiate and appreciate color just fine, but I only know a handful of color names. Well, burgundy wasn't in my package of crayons so maybe he name of that color of the shoes I received was burgundy, BUT they were nowhere near the color depicted on the web site.

Now before any aspiring technologist points out my monitor may not be calibrated etc., these were not even close. These shoes were a pinkish purple, and had zero, none, not a hint of depth to the color. It looked like these were spray painted. I was replacing a worn out pair and I had to double take on these. I even went back on line to see if I chose a different color accidentally. These were terrible. The leather was very stiff and the fit ran small.

Good points:
-the Jansport name and guarantee.
-Water bottle holder on one side of the bag (great for me in Europe, and a key factor for me buying this bag)
-decent, if not great, laptop protection
-good size--can hold a lot of stuff or a little bit of stuff without losing shape or look
-comfortable to wear on shoulder or across body
-good length of strap (and it's adjustable)

Bad points:
-the flap is held down by two small, unadjustable latches.  I've found them difficult to use one-handed, and they just seem flimsy.  I'd much rather have one heavy-duty latch.
-The shoulder padding is a bit awkward...but it can be removed, and I think it will improve as I break the bag in.
-The smaller pockets in the front are not that great in design.  If you lift the flap, there are three pockets in the front of the bag.  (There's also a large zip pocket in the flap, which is good for easy access.)  Anyway, the center pocket is OK...nothing too fancy, but a zip front and requisite card holders, key holder, etc.  Above this, there are two narrow pockets that are a few inches wide and go down the whole front of the bag (thing a tall, thin rectangle behind the main front pocket on either side).  These pockets are pretty much useless to me...they're too thin for much stuff, and they're awkward to get to for easy access.

It has a sporty look and now I use it more as an overnight/gym bag than an office bag, but it served me well carrying around books and folders for years. While the storage space was nice, some parts of the bag haven't held up well. Within the first year the water bottle holder made of mesh broke. Also it doesn't have a true handle, rather a small strip attached to the back which you can use if you need to grab the bag quickly. This broke and it gets annoying when I just want to pick up and carry the bag briefly. Lastly this bag doesn't have much padding for laptops, and while it does have a compartment, I would recommend getting an additional sleeve.

Pros:
-Lots of space
-Versatile
-Durable main compartments

-Might be too large for some people
-Water bottle holder broke

There is also this tiny piece of fabric sown on as a 'handle' to use to carry it, but it's so feeble, it's not really much of an improvement.

When I received this set, to say that I was disappointed, would be a gross understatement.  I was disgusted!  First of all, the ring was damaged/defective (whatever you want to call a mess up).  The center stone was improperly set and positioned within he prongs.  It was crooked.  And I assure you it was extremely obvious.  It didn't take any close inspection to see.  It was glaring.  Then the prongs themselves were also bent down in mismatched places on the stone, one being bent straight down the side edge of the stone vs. pointing relatively toward the center.  This only added to the overall impression of the stone being crooked.  It made the stone look as if IT were misshapen and cut wrong.

I get that you can't expect fake jewelry that costs $30 to be the same quality as the real deal... But this?  It looks like it came off the $5 carousel at walmart.  And frankly, I wouldn't have bought it from there, for that price.  It looks like crap.  It looks like a gumball machine ring, or something that could have come out of a little girl's dress up set.

Now, even had the prongs been set properly, etc. I still wouldn't have worn it.  That just added insult to injury.  The ring, had it been in perfect shape, still would have looked like something from the dollar store.  It doesn't look anymore ""real"" than a peice of glass stuck in a plastic band.  The silver even looks funny. It looks like tin foil. The reflective sheen is a dead give away.

The stones don't look like diamonds at all.  They don't even look like good immitations.  They look like cheap junk.

Also the center stone is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to large to be believable. On anybody.  It's about a 3-4 ct. stone.  It looks absurdly fake.  So unless you think that your friends might actually be able to bring themselves to believe that you could afford a $15,000.00 ring, then ummm yeah it'll be too big.

And if you can pull that off, then maybe you can also convince them that you know, all good metals are as shiny as tin foil, too.

Don't get this ring.  Don't waste your money.

Since they were such a cheap price I didn't expect them to be this nice. I wanted somethng that I could wear without having to worry about freaking out if I lost a stone out of one or banging them around when working. I am very picky, my husband says I have a little bit of OCD. I was concerened that the center stone would be to big and look fake or that the other stones would be so small you wouldn't be able to see them at all. I also was worrying about other issues that I had read about on reviews of other rings. The Size, the center stone being lose right out of the package, the stones turning black or quickly falling out. I had also read the review on this ring that said that there was a little gap between the rings because the center stone on the engagement ring was not set up high enough to let the rings nest together. So I was very anxious to actually receive the set in the mail and try them out for myself. They finally got here and I was VERY surprised to say the least. They were perfect. The stones were just the right size, not to small but not big enough they looked fake when showing people. The women at my work thought that they were real. All of the stones were secure in their settings and they are still just as sparkly now as when I took them out of the box. I wear a size 10 ring and its hard for me to find nice rings in my size. When I Took these out of the box and put them on they fit perfectly. There is a TINY gap between the rings but it is VERY TINY (so tiny I can't even think of anything that would fit in the gap between them, maybe you could get a VERY tiny knife blade between them but that s about it.) and not noticeable to anyone other than the wearer.

I needed a Wonder Woman costume asap so I paid to get it expedited, which was almost 1/2 the cost of the outfit.  But the dress arrived and was made of such an awful material and so unflattering that I ordered another - paying MORE in shipping than the cost of the new outfit.

The red top was made of some sort strange puffy rubberized felt that buckled and created a lumpy look.  The skirt was a billowing sticky plastic.  The leggings that create the thigh-high boot effect have no way of staying up on your thigh, no elastic or anything, so they just slide down your leg.  And the cape's Velcro around your neck is extremely tight without any room to loosen it.  I ordered a medium and I'm a thin person but it was sewn to fit a kid.

Look, it's alot of work and material for a very low cost and I could understand cheap workarounds to keep the price low but it's super unflattering and unworkable.","{'Size:': ' Medium', 'Color:': ' Blue/Red'}",1,Very Cheaply Made & Unflattering,Amazon Customer,,TRUE

The top was fine although shorter than I hoped for (I'm 5'10 with even proportions), but the skirt is awful. The sewing was done haphazardly and there were several places with the skirt bunched up in the seam and the fabric looked terrible. The pleats at the center were completely off center too. I took the skirt off and reattached it so it laid smoothly and was even. The skirt had several places where the blue was coming off because the material is cheap. If it got snagged on something or was pulled at all it would turn white and look awful.
Order down a size or two. If you're on the larger end of what each size will fit, order down 1 size. If you're on the smaller end of each size, go 2 sizes smaller.
I'd prefer straps on it even if they're clear or any way to keep the top up better. Because it fits such a large range there is a TON of elastic on the back and if you're not pulling it tight it doesn't stay up and had an unflattering fit.
The boot covers are poorly made too. I have big calves and they were too big on me. They won't stay up and there's no real way for the cover to stay in place. There's only an elastic that's supposed to go under your shoe but that doesn't work because It attaches with Velcro on the bottom of the shoe so you're stepping on it the whole time. The only way to keep this in place would be to spray glue it to whatever shoes your wearing. You're better off buying the actual boots which look awesome.

I would consider myself to be a long-torso person, and the top of this is still a bit too long for me.  I wish there was a good way to make it a bit shorter so that it doesn't bunch up and create the illusion of tummy rolls, which I have recently worked pretty hard to eliminate!  Overall, I have made the fit quite good, but I did remove a piece of elastic from the inside of the back of the skirt that was about 6 "" long so it pulled the skirt to the point of being so tight it hurt.  Removal of that piece and the skirt hangs very nicely and the torso fit pretty well.  The top part is definitely designed for a well-endowed person, so I had to take in a few inches there as well.  The belt was a bit tight, so I moved the Velcro over to make it fit.  The cape Velcro was positioned weird so that it scratched my neck when attached, so I moved  one piece 90 degrees to the other so that the neck attachment actually forms a ""V"" point, which I believe is how it is supposed to look.  I am currently shopping for some boots to wear because the boot covers are a bit of a joke compared to the rest of the costume, which is pretty decent quality.  Overall I do like the costume, but I would say that chances are quite slim it will fit anyone perfectly right out of the package.
My top is the fuzzy covered foam material, and the skirt is a shiny polyester.  I did buy some biking-type shorts to wear underneath for comfort, with the blue and white star pattern than matches almost perfectly.

"07 27, 2016",1469577600,A1I3UMCCILYW9L,,B000EE1NNA,"To consider the number of stars I would give this, I had to take into consideration the various components of this costume.  I am 5'6"" and 135 pounds and ordered the small costume, and it fits nicely.  Here is my review:

The bodice/skirt: the main piece of the costume consists of the bodice (top) and skirt, which are connected.  Overall, this part of the costume is pretty decently constructed, and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.  The bodice is a velvety material and has some stretch and structure to it, but I noticed other reviews mention a zipper.  Mine did not have a zipper, so I had to pull it over my head and hope not to stretch it too much.  It fits pretty snugly, but does not provide chest support, so it would most likely have to be worn with a strapless bra or bustier for a little more structure.  I am a 34D and the small provided enough coverage.  The skirt is cute, a shiny blue material with gold stars, not much else to say about that.

The knee-high boot covers: terrible and unusable!  The tops are not tight enough and sag, and the bottoms hang loosely and won't completely cover boots.  I won't wear them with this costume, and I might try to find an alternative.

The belt: fits nicely around my waist/hips, although just barely.  I could see if someone was more curvy, the belt might not fit. The belt would be better with a little stretch to it or some elastic in the back.

Arm cuffs: while the rest of the costume has gold accessories, the cuffs are silver.  They are very basic and loose on my forearms.  I will wear them, just so I have something on my wrists, but I might spray paint them gold.

Head piece: will work just fine!  It is as pictured and wraps around the head and fastens with Velcro.

Cape: lightweight and fastens around the neck.  The Velcro fasteners are a little scratchy on my neck, but it's a costume, so I expect a little Velcro here and there.  Thankfully, the cape helps to hide some of the imperfections of the bodice.

I should mention that I had to exchange my costume for another in the same size because the bodice of the costume had some weird bulging on the sides that made it look like I have rolls under my arms and on my sides.  I haven't received the replacement, so I hope it will be sewn a little more carefully.","{'Size:': ' Small', 'Color:': ' Blue/Red'}",3,"Overall a good costume for the price, with some design flaws.",K_Stahl,,TRUE

The skirt is short as expected and I will be wearing some type of boy short or something underneath. The belt does not fit at all! It fits my head and is essentially the same length as the head band! The silver arm bands are fairly cheesy. Almost look like they belong to an astronaut costume. I think I may try to make my own if I have time. The boot covers aren't great. They are really long but could be tucked in. The material is transparent but on top of boots, that wouldn't matter. I don't think they will stay on though as there is no elastic in the toe to keep them in place. There is a strap that goes underneath, but it was still loose for me. I think I'll end up spray painting a pair of boots I use for costumes anyway. The cape is made of polyurethane foam, it seems like it all is, but will work fine.

I am either a 10 or a 12 in most items, so I was torn as to what size to order. I have a slim waist but I 'm curvy and I also didn't want it to be too short, so I got a medium thinking that would be the right size, since it would be a ""Big Medium,"" which is the size I would normally wear anyway.

I should have gotten a small.

The bottom half of the dress fit fine, but the top was baggy.  I wear a DD cup so this is not usually I problem I encounter, but the issue lay in the fabric the top is made out of. It's velveteen on the outside but the lining is this awful foamy stuff, presumably used to give the top more structure.  The top fit okay through the chest, only a little loose, but because it was cut funny it was very bunchy through the waist and the foam lining only made this bunching more noticeable. I could grab an handful of the elasticized portion in the back, it was very loose.  If they had nixed the foam lining I could have altered this to skim over my curves better but alas, the stiffness of the lining made it too hard to pin attractively.

It made me look like I had rolls because of the way it bunched at the waist.  Definitely buy the smallest size you think you can get away with to avoid all the extra fabric.

Otherwise a good costume.  I didn't wear the bootcovers because I wore red tights instead but everything else was at least okay. I liked the shine of the skirt.","{'Size:': ' Medium', 'Color:': ' Blue/Red'}",3,I just wish it fit better.,Nina,,TRUE

I talked her into this costume and it looks great on her!  As she is larger chested, it doesn't want to stay up, being that it is strapless.  She added nude colored straps which help hold it up, and isn't noticeable.  Also, the gauntlets are large, so fitted them with some velcro to sinch tighter.  The boot covers don't want to stay up, so added a small string of elastic around the top to keep them up over regular boots.  The cape neck is way to tight.

I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing the costume and many people said the sizes ran large, but I told myself that I would rather buy something that's large and alter it then be stuck with something that doesn't fit. So I looked at the size chart and selected a large based on the measurements they put down for the bust. It said that the large would fit those with a bust size of 38-40 inches, but the dress was falling off of my chest even though I wear a 36DD. It was also way too big around my waist and hips. I personally altered the dress and took in approximately 2 inches from each side (total of 4 inches). I also had to alter the wrist bands because they were a total of 3 inches too big for my wrist. After altering everything, it looked great on, and everybody loved it.

It's plenty long and is made of good quality, considering it is a halloween costume. The extras that come with it (crown and arm cuffs) look cheap, so I recommend getting the gold crown and cuffs that another distributor carry. The boot covers are great if you already have a tall boot to wear them over, but if you're foot is larger then a 7, you will have a couple inches of your actual boot showing at the toe, which isn't really a big deal.

I am 5' 3"" and 107 lbs, 32A and the top bulged like a bubble in the back and ruffled on the sides. Safety pins weren't enough- the chest was still loose and the sides were still bulgy. The belt was loose too, and attaches by velcro (with no varieties in tightness). The cuffs are loose, but not terrible- a thin, foam material with shiny metal fabric on top that are also difficult to lose their flat shape from shipping. Too bad they weren't just shiny spandex like in the picture.

Cape and boots are not as pictured- cape has a large, unadjustable neck (as oppose to the choker-like one in the picture) and just hangs back from your throat feeling like a loose choke. Boots tops are velvet with an elastic strap meant to go under your arch, and are also kind of loose. The velvet material makes it look Santa- themed. I wouldn't use it with this costume.

All in all, an XS is much too large for a 5'3"", 108 lb person. I wasn't able to tweak it to work. If you have basic sewing skills, then this costume would work. The top is attractive velvety and the skirt is shiny and not too short. It is definitely a more modest costume if that's what you're going for, and if you can get the right size. Order a size down.

Con's- dress is huge. I am 5'10"", 175lbs, 36DD and luckily I sew, as I did have to take in the top in order for the dress to stay on.  The boot covers were flimsy and took a lot of double sided tape to cover my own boots and stick on my knees.
Also, I did purchase the WW wig, which looked awesome and was worth the $20. Since I'm keeping the costume I am going to invest in the ""real"" WW boots.
I am a teacher and wore this recently to school.  The skirted dress made it appropriate to wear to school and I did wear a flesh-colored bodysuit on top in case of a wardrobe malfunction.
Everyone was wowed and the children and parents loved it.  After a couple of modifications, this costume looked great.  I will keep it and wear it for a long time.","{'Size:': ' Large', 'Color:': ' Blue/Red'}",4,Not a bad product for the price.,Stinky Bunny,,TRUE

I'm a size 8 and followed other reviewers' suggestions to order a size down. My chest is on the larger side and this still fit very well. The foamy tiara and cuffs are ok, but I purchased the metal ones and they were MUCH nicer! The boot cover things that come with this costume are a joke. I bought ""Funtasma by Pleaser Women's Halloween GOGO-305,Red/White Stretch Patent"" from Amazon to complete my outfit instead. The gold V belt is not attached, so it moved a lot during the night. I would definitely try to find a way to attach it before wearing this again. Another reviewer also mentioned adding a hook and eye closure at the top of the zipper, which I did because the zipper does not ""lock"" closed at the top.

I ordered a medium for my daughter (5'8, 130 lb) and it fit her almost perfectly.  A little looser (meaning, not skin tight) and a little longer than expected.  The 'little longer than expected' was a positive as this costume was to be for her to get extra credit at school.  The skirt in the picture shows it a little shorter than I think would have been allowed for regular skirts in school, so the fact it was a little longer than the picture is a good thing!

While it came packaged in a plastic bag, the quality was much better than I expected for the price.  It does not seems as though the fringe will be falling off, which is good.

The dress is slightly low in back, but not excessively so and the front is pretty modest.  The straps of the dress have fringe on them (didn't notice it in the pics).

Overall, very impressed with the quality of this product for the price.  Very good value.

Will update with how well it wore while my daughter was at school.  She has to wear it to school for a 'prohibition party' in a class, so I will know exactly how well it holds up.","{'Size:': ' Medium', 'Color:': ' Black'}",5,Excellent value for the price.  Fit almost perfect.,M. Lee,,TRUE

The costume fit perfectly and she said it was very comfortable.  I had purchased California Costumes in the past, and had knowledge of what a quality costume they make.  This costume was just as pictured in the description and it was a great hit with my wonderful bride.  The costume held up well, and I was able to fold the costume back up and put it in the original packaging again and we will use it for a Halloween event sometime in the future.  California Costumes really does a great job.  We currently have three California Costumes, and I would definitely purchase from them again.  Their fit guides and descriptions are consistent with the actual product, and the quality can't be beat.  I have included a picture of us in our costumes...her is the California Costume, mine is just a deconstructed suit that I made into a gangster costume.  (P.S.

I am 5""5, 116 lbs, have a small chest and usually wear a small in everything. But I ordered a medium because that's what all the reviews said to do, and the dress is definitely too big. I'm actually fine with it, because it's just a little too baggy and long which actually gives it more of a genuine 1920's look (clothes kind of hung on women back then and were not form fitting).
So, all in all, I would say that if you are looking for this dress to fit you right, and maybe be a little sexier, buy the size you usually wear. If you have some time before the event you're wearing it to, you can always send it back and re-order if it's too big/small.
As far as the product goes, I'm very happy with the quality and everything about the dress. It smells horribly of chemical plastic, so give it some time to air out.

I got it just in case it looked good and more the part for the Great Gatsby themed party I went to than my own velveteen long black dress. Glad I had my own dress to wear.  This dress was so tight even my slim, teenage daughter had a hard time fitting into it. And that was the extra-large size.
I bought it thinking that if it was a little too small it would be fine for the children's dressing up box. So will wait till my youngest hits  about age 9 and then she should fit into it! No joke.

I expected and got costume quality, which was cheap, but better than spending $200 on a vintage dress I might not wear again! I ordered a large; I normally wear a size 10-12, which can run from medium to large, so I thought I was playing it safe but this dress was so tight in the hips that I could barely get it on. My husband had to help me get into it and because the hips were so tight in the dress, the costume ended up being ridiculously short, so that I had to wear bike shorts underneath to keep it from being obscene! I'm pretty sure flappers were known for loose-fitting clothing, not tight, constrictive clothing.

Firstly, I read all the reviews and ordered the small assuming it would fit me b/c the majority of reviews state that it runs small or even extremely small. This is very relative. This is definitely not a junior's small, and arguably a women's small.

Here's my size info in case it helps:

5'5""
103 lbs
32 B

As for the quality, it's pretty good for a bagged costume. You're definitely gonna lose a few strands of the fringe but the slink and drape are good and the under-construction is plenty sturdy for the weight of the fringe. It's not going in your washing machine, but it's a much better look, feel, and quality than the average costume in this price-range.

I like the headband with feather that it came with. Fits with the costume theme. For the price and quality, it's not so bad. I'd definitely recommend this costume to many friends so we can go as a flock of flapper girls to Halloween parties this year!!

You can dress up the dress with a feather boa and gloves that you'd have to buy separately, which I prefer more over an entire costume that has the gloves and boa... I'd prefer to buy it separately.

I had ordered a verrrry thick (and equally long) terry robe a few weeks earlier and just found the extreme weight of it to be offputting every time I reached for it.  I thought - I do need the warmest robe (and full ankle length) I can find, but does it really have to be SO heavy?  Then I went searching and found THIS robe - got it today and it envelopes my body wonderfully just like the terry robe, but it's LIGHT.  Thick, plush and light.  I am every bit as warm, but far more comfortable, and it has a really good quality fluffy texture -- doesn't look cheap or tacky as some micro fiber or synthetic robes I've seen which have more of the look of fake fur or a skimpy uneven pile or a ""trailer trash"" look; grungy, old and lived in from day one.  No, this robe looks luxurious and evokes a spa, and somehow as thick as it is, it even manages not to make you look enormous, that part was a surprise.

The only thing I would wish if for another 2-3 inches in length.  I am 5'9"", 140 pounds, and ordered the large. I really couldn't go with X or XX Large just for more length - the bottom of the robe comes to 7 inches from the ground (or 3 inches from my ankles) - pretty much like the photo of the man - it doesn't come as far down as the one the woman is wearing (clearly she's shorter).  I get that robe makers can't please everyone and I'm somewhat tall for a woman so they can't make robes long enough for me that would drag the floor for other women. But I wish it was longer anyway.  I do feel the draft on the few inches of my exposed ankles.  And no I don't want to bend my aching back in the morning to struggle with pulling on socks in the morning before I have my coffee.  The whole point of a robe and slippers is you just stumble groggily and slip easily into them and done - an all-in-one solution.

Because the robe arrived with a faint chemical smell I immediately washed it, separately, so the color would not run.

However, nearly everything else didn't work for me:

1) I ordered the red color and it looked faded, not nearly as rich and lush as the red shown in the picture, it was more like rust. Not a big deal if color doesn't matter for you. It just bothered me that I paid 85 dollars for this and it looks ratty out of the box. I would advise getting a lighter color like the lavender.

2) Next, while the length was exactly what I was looking for, the width of this robe is extremely wide. I wear a women's size 4 pants and this robe has just too much fabric to fit comfortably. It is bulky on me. What's weird is that the arms were an exact fit, so if I went down a size to X-Small, I think the arms would be too short.

All this to say, it would have been worth the money for me if the fit was more precise. If that were the case, I'd just send it back with a color change.

I do understand the difficulty this represents to companies, but maybe there could be an un-hemmed version that we could take to the tailors.  If un-hemmed robes were available, we would have the ability to make it the garment full length and keep our ankles warm.  Cold feet are one of the main problems for many people, and a full length robe is a much more elegant look than one that is cropped at the ankles.  Of course, if it came un-hemmed, one could also crop it at the ankles if that is the desired length.

I expect this robe will wash and dry like a dream, too, although I haven't tested it yet since it is a gift.  The only other suggestion I would make is that I would love to have options of having an option of maybe a few very feminine robes with gorgeous A lines with flattering colors (like this cranberry color) suitable for new mothers and Valentine's Day and Mother's Day and Christmas, etc., to remind women of their feminine beauty without sacrificing cozy!...with matching slippers!!!","{'Size:': ' Large', 'Color:': ' Cranberry'}",5,"Cozy and Warm, But Wish There Were Tall Robes",Brenda Willis-Ford,,TRUE

"12 26, 2006",1167091200,A1QOK9LU90ACF7,,B000EYDK7M,"Briefly, I had a childhood accident 30+ years ago that caused arthritis in my foot.  Not bad, but a constant, nagging pain sensation that I learned to just live with.  Finally, I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain.  I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I've never turned back.

They're great.  No more foot pain, period.  I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday (in an office environment -- I got flack for that from co-workers, but the needling didn't bother me and management never took me to task, either), to church, everywhere.  I've a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work -- not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona's.  The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time.

Admittedly, it's a lot of money to spend, but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re-soles the Birkies for about $30, and will replace the cork and sole both for about $50.  The re-soled sandals last about a year, but remember, I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day.

In short, these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me.  Not bad for a little more than $100.",,5,It's all I wear,Centriculous,8,TRUE

It comes with 4 different timer settings and 3

different turning direction settings: left, right and alternating.

I calculated the number of rotations per day based some measurements.

Setting:

  A:  rotate 33 seconds, rest 12 minutes:  300  rotations/day

  B:  rotate 10 minutes, rest 90 minutes:  660  rotations/day

  C:  rotate 30 minutes, rest 3 hours  :  940  rotations/day

  D:  rotate 1 hour, rest 3 hours  :  1700 rotations/day

I use setting B for my watch with ETA 2824 movement. Every watch has a specific requirement as of how many rotations per day it needs to remain fully wound. See you watch specifications.

The shapers are two pieces of pink plastic connected by two strips of metal. The strip of metal are curved and attached (in the most ineffective way you could ever imagine)to each piece of plastic. You are supposed to squeeze together to place into your boot and then release to maintain the shape of the boot. All of this is wonderful in theory, but the poor construction precludes easy use of the shaper without constantly having to reinsert the metal strips into the tiny little clips cut out for them in the plastic. This is a waste of time and, as some other users have noted, quite dangerous. I think you could seriously injure yourself with these if you got a flying strip of metal in the face as you're trying to put it into your boot. I put them into my boots facing away from me, but the metal strip still flies out and scares me 1 out of every 2 times I use it. Next time I will invest in something better constructed and less dangerous.

We finally sprung for a tux and I was looking for a formal shirt that was nice, yet not crazy expensive.  This one fit the bill.  I was not expecting much due to some of the reviews but the most recent reviews looked positive so I ordered. On Amazon, I always go by the most recent reviews because that carries more weight to me than one from 2009 or so.  My husband  is  5'8, 42 inch waist and wears a 20 neck 34/35 sleeve, so I chose the 20 34/35 on Amazon as the option.  When took it out of the package, this shirts tag just says ""4X' on the inside (but their sticker on the onside of the package said 20, 34/35). He tried it on and everything was perfect but the neck was a little large (before adding a tie). Just a little bigger than he liked, leaving a little gap.  However, sleeves, belly area, everything fit PERFECT besides the neck being a little too large.  So, I washed the shirt in hot water and put it in the dryer and the neck is now absolutely perfect. Fits him 100% now.  The shirt looks great and fits like a dream.  The quality is great for the price.

The button studs that come with the shirt are very cheap plastic and on the small side (as you'd expect for free) and you could get away with them for a one time event like a wedding or formal event, but if you will wear the shirt over and over I'd go for nicer studs. Also, I had no quality control issues.  All the stitching is just fine -- the shirt was not thin as one review said. We are very pleased.

"12 17, 2017",1513468800,A5KRM3621UHG1,,B000GHMRLW,"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length.",,5,"Order 2"" longer than you need",Brian Foreman,,TRUE

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more.

I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead.

I have also found that Wrangler 20X style 33 ""extreme relaxed"" jeans also fit me and my bigger thighs well)","{'Size:': ' 42W x 32L', 'Color:': ' Mushroom'}",5,Paging Mr. Big Thighs......We have your pants!,MJackson,93,TRUE

The fit/cut is excellent. If you love the old Levi's 560 (Loose Fit) before Levi's started using cheaper materials, less quality control and changed the cut, you will love these pants. They are extremely comfortable.
On the downside, they are incredibly prone to wrinkle up. I need to iron them after every time I wear them (which is obviously ridiculous). In fact, even after a couple of hours, you already see very visible wrinkles. No other pants I have ever had needed anything like this. I wish the firm fixed this.

"05 7, 2013",1367884800,A13BHNLBPVWAYH,,B000GHMRLW,"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

I am disappointed at how small the right side ""change"" or ""watch"" pocket is, compared o most carpenter jeans. Items that ride comfortably in the watch pocket of my other carpenter jeans either don't fit, or ride up and dig into my side, if I stick them in the change pocket of these pants.","{'Size:': ' 36W x 32L', 'Color:': ' Charcoal'}",4,"Run a little tight, but good",Winston Smith,,FALSE

Some reviewers said that they needed to order several sizes larger in order to get the right fit so I initially ordered a size 35x32. I'm a tall, skinny guy and I typically wear pants with a size 32 or 33 waist. 35 turned out to be about three inches too large so I exchanged them for a size 33, which fits comfortably, but definitely requires a belt. I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

EDIT: 12/13/13, They continue to be excellent.

I was hesitant to purchase these online after reading the reviews about the sizing problems. I decided to buy them anyways and was prepared to exchange them if they didn't fit. I normally wear a 34/32 but ordered a pair of these in 38/32. When I receieved them and tried them on they were a little big in the waste but nothing a belt wouldn't fix. After washing and drying them they did shrink a little bit. I have to say that these are the most comfortable work pants I have worn. When they say loose fit they really mean it. They are very roomy but not to the point where they are baggy. They also have a few handy pockets for a utility knife/screwdriver or even a cell phone. I just placed an order for 4 more pairs in various colors so I have a pair for each day of the work week.

"12 17, 2017",1513468800,A5KRM3621UHG1,,B000GHRZN2,"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length.",,5,"Order 2"" longer than you need",Brian Foreman,,TRUE

The material is heavy duty, but light for summertime in Florida comfort. Also these pants look dressier than jeans, the color is much fuller than the pix show, real deep color. Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit. I would recommend keeping the packaging and getting a size up as there has been a rash of too small Carharrt items lately, and with that said it is still worth the trouble to get ahold of these canvas slacks.

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

I first ordered a 34 waist after reading others having size problems. I could not even get them over my hips. Sent them back and got 36 waist. They barely fit and since they are cotton I know once I wash them they won't fit. Guess I'm going to have to get a size 38. Which is way off from my normal 32 inch waist in all brands of jeans.

They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more.

The second pair (navy blue) I already bought before I wore the first pair and they were also too long but not like the first pair, both pants exact same listed sizes (the labels), it was this product so they are both the same line, same model just different colors.

I've never had the listed inseam so wrong this tells me they have zero QA process and I want to let people know, I'd stay away at all costs.  Both pairs unwearable, did not match at all the listed inseam, and also the pairs were different lengths from each other, what's going on?

I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead.

"05 7, 2013",1367884800,A13BHNLBPVWAYH,,B000GHRZN2,"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

I am disappointed at how small the right side ""change"" or ""watch"" pocket is, compared o most carpenter jeans.

I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

I'd not heard of this company before, so I checked their website (they are a long-established German watch manufacturer), so I took a chance. This watch is a BEAUTY! It's far and away the best looking ""skel"" I've found for the price, and if the almost $800 retail price is to be believed (MSRP on watches is highly inflated), then this watch is a steal. The only other watch I was considering was an Android with a metal bracelet (an entirely different look) and at almost twice the price. I did notice there is no country of manufacture shown anywhere on the watch or the packaging. Although this is a German company, it makes me wonder if they are making these in China or someplace overseas. I've got only a few complaints-the clasp is difficult to open/close and the gold hands can be difficult to see (no contrast with the gold mechanism and no illumination).

I bought this watch as a gift for my father and he loved it. In terms of looks, the watch is probably one of the most amazing ones that I've ever seen; It's defiantly far better than any of the mechanical / skeleton watches currently on the market. I looked at hundreds, but this one caught my eye. It's the most ""skeletal"" of the watches, while still retaining elegance.
The picture does not do it justice, it is even nicer in person.
It is shipped in a nice box that has the watch presented on a holder when opened. It defiantly adds to the beauty of the watch.

Cons:
The second, minute, and hour hands can be a little bit hard to see, as it is gold on gold. Some people could have a hard time reading it.
As other people have mentioned, it is not as heavy as it looks.
It is a bit pricey.

Conclusion:
This watch is one that i would recommend buying. It is unlike many that I have seen and would make a great present or nice watch for yourself. It costs more than a lot of watches out there, but it's also a lot cooler than most. In reality the price is cheap compared to other high-end watches.

People whine it's light weight, pointers are difficult to see...hey weight is no problem.  Do you want a droopy arm that is sore from a heavy watch?  If it weighed more you would then be complaining about your sore arm or the discomfort of a heavy watch wrapped around your wrist.

Mixed reviews and for a good reason:

This is a beautiful watch, design is awesome, weight is somewhat light but it doesn't feel plastic and that's because it's stainless steel. Not heavy, like some reviewers mention but it i think that makes this watch very confortable exactly because of that.

At this price, i thought it was a good purchase, and i'm very happy with it.
Keeps good time, mine doesn't loose that many minutes as some said but this is not the kind of watch you look for accuracy, it's a fun watch to wear and in that case, it's very cool.
It's flashy, too much perhaps. I agree that this watch seems very ambitious since everyone will notice that golden ""thing"" in your wrist and it certainly seems like a expensive watch.

It has indeed a chinese movement so this is not that great jewerly many were saying it should be but it's not expensive and as such i think people are beeing a bit harsh when saying this is not a high quality piece. You get what you payed for: a fun, cheap enough watch that looks awesome. Design is above all other qualities with this watch but that's ok for the price and i can't find anything like it anywhere! That's great! :) It is unique and impressive!
You will not find another watch in this price range that looks like this. Compact and nice to look at, perfect for parties! ;)

Like our friend from Moscow says, be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!

Pointers are difficult to see in anything but good light but then again, you buy this watch for looks, not function. ;)
Not the easiest watch to wind because crown is too close to case but other than that, i have no complaints.
Nice to have in your collection unless you only like superior, non chinese watches.

I personally own a BAUME MERCIER Capeland model and was expecting a awesome piece.  here's my thoughts:  I do agree with some reviews about the weight..it feels very light , like there is no substance to it...almost ""plasticky"".  For a retail of $798..I was expecting a heavier watch.
  Other reviews are correct about the time hands blending in with the background...IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE THE TIME.  buy this more for the look , because you will definitely have a hard time see the time hands.
  The packaging is nice with a nice box. The phamplets and manual are very simple, nothing special. No country of origins on anything it comes in. NONE, NADA, ZILCH.
  I actually contemplated sending it bsck because i was dissapointed at first, i decided to wear it for a few days so be sure.
  I found that IT IS VERY EYE CATCHING. people will ask you about it and if you need a conversation starter...this will work. I actually grew to like it and am keeping it. For $198 ( what I paid ) it's not too bad for a watch piece...i don't know if this will be an HEIRLOOM PIECE, i doubt it, but it is nice looking so for sentimental value it does have an appeal.
  It is now part of my wardrobe with my other watches. if you are looking for a skeleton watch, this is not too bad of a choice...it will do fine. If you are expecting too much...this may not be the watch for you.

I purchased a Large at first and had to return it for a Medium. I am usually a 16 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves for my 5' 7"" 170# frame. I found that the Medium shirt (15 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves) was still a little baggy from under the arms to the waist and little too big in the neck. It also ran a little long. I had it cut flat at the bottom to reduce length and the amount of shirt tail in my pants. Also had sides altered to fit me better. I guess that was about $15.

(46 - 48 waist, and I'm only about 6 ft.)  Fearing, that this might run a little small, I went with a sized 20 collar with a 34/35 sleeve.  First off, I was super impressed and happy that this shirt was actually made in that size, so THANK YOU.  That said, the shirt seemed a bit bigger than expected and needed some tailoring to get it right.

In the neck area, I had a little room, making the shirt very comfortable.  Additionally, the sleeves were cut perfectly.  However, the rest of the shirt fit me kind of big and I had to have my tailor both cut the length of the shirt (probably about 3 or 4 inches!) and take the shirt in about 4 inches.

I fit in the top half fits mostly ok. the ""apron ties""  are loose and hang. I have a 38 DDD chest and they lay limp. So I will be reattaching them so it lays nice.
The bottom half fits OK but pulls a little.
The packaging says for the XL size it fits up to size 22. I don't think it would. It's stretchy but the slit might rip and you would probably look like you're in a maid sausage casing. I should also say I tried it on while wearing spanx and a corset. Chest measurement 45"", waist 37"" and hips 52""
My proportions are off for where the waist line hits. It's almost a drop waist on me. And its surprisingly short. I'm short so I figured it would be about knee length. Its easily 4"" above the knee. and then there is the slit- which is almost panty flashing. So I'm wearing a yoga boy shorts so I'm not flashing.
Costume is a kind of cheap but it will work. I wish I didn't spend nearly $50 on it- isn't worth the price. If I hadn't decided to throw a RHPS party in 10 days I probably would have looked elsewhere or asked a local seamstress to make a costume.

However I purchased a recent pair back in Sept (2017), that December the fabric started to tear around the elastic on the left side of the right shoe.

I contacted the seller (Gbrandshop) about a warranty/refund but they sent me to Vans for that. Vans shut the case down outright, stating they only warranty shoes bought through their authorized resellers, I was asked to handle it through the Amazon shop.

But I love these shoes, they are too small and they leak. No big deal until I'm at the game and I use the restroom and step in piss.

Great for Hacky Sack, summer days at the beach... and for causing new and interesting aromas when worn without socks, heheheh.
I wear 10.5 US Mens... these fit as expected. Always they start a bit snug. I wear them a few hours at a time until they stretch and get a little torn here and there.
Funny thing is, there is no real arch support in these things - and they only come in one width that I know of - and of course, I wear at least an E width in boots - and I have arches that rival any bridge... but they never make my feet hurt...?

She was delighted that I got her just what she wanted, but the women's size 6.5 that she normally wears is a bit tight and she asked if I could exchange them for a size 7.  Unfortunately, it was just past the 30 days return policy.  Now she has a pair of shoes too small for her and it seems like there is nothing that I can do.  The shoes are unworn (other than just trying them on for size) and in the original packaging... I'm wondering if Amazon would be willing to make an exchange for the women's size 7 red checkerboard Vans Unisex Slip On Skate Shoes.
Please advise..

I have had an olive green and black checkerboard pair, a turquoise/sky blue and black checkerboard pair and a black and white checkerboard pair when I about 12 years old.  I wish they would keep making the classic colors and stop phasing them out.  I especially like the styling of the black webbing between the tongue and the sidewalls.  This is my first all black pair and I'm really liking them.  The first pair of shoes I've ever had that I actually want to stay clean and looking brand new.  I really hope that Vans keep these classics in production forever!  I've become so addicted to the ease of the slip-on shoe.
The only down side might be that they are a bit tight on my toes and a tad uncomfortable and stiff at the beginning.  I know from past experience though, that they break in very quickly then they feel very comfortable.

The heel cup seems to be tighter or cut slightly differently. Once one, the shoe feels the same as the right, and there is no excessive rubbing or tightness around the heel. The left was a struggle to get on for a week or so, but it's getting easier. I have had several pair of the Vans classic slip-on, and I have never had this problem before. Oh, and the label tag at the back of the right show wasn't completely glued on because of the seam where the white band of the sole overlapped in the back. Not a major issue. I just put some super glue back there before I wore them around and it's been fine since. Maybe these were factory ""B' grade shoes, I dunno. Still, they fit well, I can wear them around without any problems, and they look good.

***They ask if these shoes provide good arch support. I said ""No"", because they aren't really built for that, probably due to the 'classic' design. I've had several pairs of this style shoe from Vans over the years and I don't expect them to provide the arch support of a sportier sneaker.

I always ordered them directly from Vans, although my son (who is an avid fan of Amazon; Scotsil@gmail.com, one of your most loyal and best customers, as he is a shopaholic) told me to order the sneakers from your site and, in fact, they were approximately $10 less expensive.  As soon as I got them, I checked the size (which was the same as I had ordered for my last three pairs) and then threw out the box, assuming (unfortunately) that they would fit.  After wearing them a number of times, I knew that they were way too big and were causing me back pain.  I therefore went to a local shoe repair shop and purchased pads (two per shoe, as the gap was so wide) to go on the back interior.  However, they are not working, although I do not believe they are a knockoff/imitation of a true Van's sneaker.  Please note that I rarely complain about these issues, especially when the amount in controvery is only $35.  However, it is extremely annoying as I threw out my old vans and now cannot wear the new ones which will require me to go to the store in the mall during this very busy Holiday Season.  I understand if there is nothing you can do to accomodate me but, if there is, it will transform me into the same customer my son is.  Thank you for your consideration.
